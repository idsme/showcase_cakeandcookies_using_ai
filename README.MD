# Cake and Cookies on AI
Used ChatGPT and input backery websites with good functionality to generate a basic PRD.
Then finetuned by hand. 

## How
Took the input PRD and asked Claude Sonnet not Opus to generate a landing page to see how it would do.
Then, when I was happy with the overal site layout, which look like medior designer quality. Took Sonnet's output
and inputted into Opus and asked it to review it as an enterprise level designer and upgrade it to the next level.

## Results
Difference was a good level up. I would say 85% usable. But seeing the reason from some improvements. I asked it to change a few things.

### The bad and ugly
Which many went oke. But asking Opus to change a background gradient onhover of some cards is where I hit a limit.
As it changed the background of the main page. Where there was a gradient and infact it is under the cards.
But it could not be encouraged to change the onhover card grandient. Which was a nasty hotpink to gold grandient.
Man that stuff hurts eyes.

### The good.
All in all. 
When from zero to having a production worthy brand-voice, PRD and webiste for Cake and Cookies in about 6 hours.
I feel it reduced the time it would take bij hand for 95%. Just look at the results.
